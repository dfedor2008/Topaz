                                                                            Topaz

Topaz is a PCB which uses a SX1262 radio to send morse code up to 13 km. It can also be used to send temperature :).
The microcontroller is a SAMD21 which is a great microcontroller which I used because of my previous experience with it.
The barometric pressure sensor is a BME 280. It is a cheap and reliable pressure, temperature, and humidity sensor.


Application notes:
After getting the PCB you should begin by soldering it. If you have a heating plate, then I would use it for sure.
After soldering check for shorts and plug in the PCB (not to your computer) . If you see smoke, imedaitly unplug the
pcb and check for shorts. If there are no shorts then plug it into your computer.
