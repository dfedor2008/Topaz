                                                                            Topaz

Topaz
Topaz is a low-cost, long-range GPS telemetry system based on a custom PCB. It uses an SX1262 LoRa radio to send Morse code or telemetry data up to 13 km. It can also transmit temperature, pressure, and humidity using a BME280 sensor.

Overview
Microcontroller: SAMD21 â€” chosen for reliability and familiarity.

Radio: SX1262 â€” supports long-range communication using LoRa.

Sensor: BME280 â€” measures temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure.

GPS: ATGM336H â€” provides real-time location and telemetry data.

Why I Made This Project
I originally built Topaz as a personal GPS tracker to monitor my frequently late bus. Later, I realized it could also be used for fun applicationsâ€”like tracking my brother during a game of hide and seek!

This idea quickly expanded into a general-purpose tracking system that can be used for many projects involving remote data transmission.

Use Cases
Topaz can be used in a variety of real-world and hobbyist applications:

Tracking hikers or groups in remote areas

Recovery of rockets or weather balloons

Monitoring environmental conditions

Custom telemetry projects without relying on cellular networks

How It Works
The ATGM336H GPS module collects location and telemetry data.

The SAMD21 processes the data and controls device operation.

The SX1262 LoRa module transmits the data in Morse code or as packets.

A second Topaz device can act as a receiver, enabling two-way communication.

All code is written in C++ using well-supported sensor libraries.

Application Notes
After receiving the PCB:

Solder the board â€” a heating plate is recommended if you have one.

Inspect for shorts â€” especially around the microcontroller and power lines.

Power the board (not via computer USB yet) â€” if you see smoke, unplug immediately and re-check the solder joints.

Once no shorts are found, plug into your computer via USB.

ðŸ”§ The firmware will be uploaded after PCB assembly. The entire design is optimized for low cost and reliability.
